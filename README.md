# Report.pdf - It contains the step wise explanation of the job done on the dataset (Deezer Europe.csv) and the entire working as a Deezer Europe.csv - The raw dataset of all the linked nodes in a .csv file. Introduction & About 
# A social network of Deezer users which was collected from the public API in March 2020. Nodes are Deezer users from European countries and edges are mutual follower relationships between them. The vertex features are extracted based on the artists liked by the users. The task related to the graph is binary node classification - one has to predict the gender of users. This target feature was derived from the name field for each user
# Conclusion -This experiment suggests that the dataset has many items which are interrelated to each other and links between European countries and mutual followers that have strong relationship with each other. There are 41 communities and filtering them suggests that the top 2 communities are bonded strong enough.
